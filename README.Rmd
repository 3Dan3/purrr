[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/purrr)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=purrr)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tidyverse/purrr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tidyverse/purrr)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/tidyverse/purrr/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/tidyverse/purrr?branch=master)

purrr enhances R's functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. If you've never heard of FP before, the best place to start is the family of `map()` functions which allow you to replace many for loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read.

## Installation

Get the released version from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("purrr")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/purrr")
```

## Examples

The following example uses purrr to solve a fairly realistic problem: split a data frame into pieces, fit a model to each piece, summarise and extract R^2.

```{r}
library(purrr)

mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>% # from base R
  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

This example illustrates some of the advantages of purrr functions over the equivalents in base R:

* The first argument is always the data, so purrr works naturally with the pipe.

* All purrr functions are type-stable. They always return the advertised output
  type (`map()` returns lists; `map_dbl()` returns double vectors), or they 
  throw an errror.
  
* All `map()` functions either accept function, formulas (used for succinctly
  generating anonymous functions), a character vector (used to extract 
  components by name), or a numeric vector (used to extract by position).

## API

### Transformation

* Apply a function to each element: `map()` returns a list;
  `map_lgl()`/`map_int()`/`map_dbl()`/`map_chr()` return a vector; 
  `walk()` invisibly returns original list, calling the function for its side 
  effects; `map2()` and `pmap()` vectorise over multiple inputs; 

* Modify a data structure with `modify()`, at a certain depth with
  `modify_depth()`, where a predicate is true with `modify_if()`,
  or at specified locations with `modify_at()`.

* Reduce a list to a single value by iteratively applying a binary
  function: `reduce()` and `reduce_right()`.

* Figure out if a list contains an object: `has_element()`.

### List manipulation and creation

* Transpose a list with `transpose()`.

* Create the cartesian product of the elements of several lists with
  `cross()` or `cross_df()`.

* Flatten a list with `flatten()`, `flatten_lgl()`, `flatten_int()`, 
  `flatten_dbl()`, and `flatten_chr()`.

### Predicate functions

(A predicate function is a function that either returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`)

* `keep()` or `discard()` elements that satisfy the predicate..

* Does `every()` element or `some()` elements satisfy the predicate?

* Find the value (`detect()`) and index (`detect_index()`) of the first element
  that satisfies the predicate.

* Find the head/tail that satisfies a predicate: `head_while()`, `tail_while()`.

### Lists of functions

* `invoke()` every function in a list with given arguments and returns
  a list, `invoke_lgl()`/`invoke_int()`/`invoke_dbl()`/`invoke_chr()` returns 
  vectors.
  
* `invoke_map()` every function in a list with different arguments for each
  call.

### Function operators

* Fill in function arguments with `partial()`.

* Change the way your function takes input with `lift()` and the
  `lift_xy()` family of composition helpers.

* Compose multiple functions into a single function with `compose()`.

* Negate a predicate funtion with `negate()`.

### Objects coercion

* Convert an array or matrix to a list with `array_tree()` and
  `array_branch()`.

* Convert a list to a vector with `as_vector()`.

## Philosophy

The goal is not to try and simulate Haskell in R: purrr does not implement currying or destructuring binds or pattern matching. The goal is to give you similar expressiveness to an FP language, while allowing you to write code that looks and works like R.

* Instead of point free style, use the pipe, `%>%`, to write code that can be
  read from left to right.

* Instead of currying, we use `...` to pass in extra arguments.

* Anonymous functions are verbose in R, so we provide two convenient shorthands.
  For unary functions, `~ .x + 1` is equivalent to `function(.x) .x + 1`.
  For chains of transformations functions, `. %>% f() %>% g()` is
  equivalent to `function(.) . %>% f() %>% g()`.

* R is weakly typed, we need variants `map_int()`, `map_dbl()`, etc since we 
  don't know what `.f` will return.

* R has named arguments, so instead of providing different functions for
  minor variations (e.g. `detect()` and `detectLast()`) I use a named
  argument, `.right`. Type-stable functions are easy to reason about so
  additional arguments will never change the type of the output.
