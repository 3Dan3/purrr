## Overview

purrr enhances R's functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. If you've never heard of FP before, the best place to start is the family of `map()` functions which allow you to replace many for loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read. The best place to learn about the `map()` functions is the [iteration chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) in R for data science.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get purrr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just purrr:
install.packages("purrr")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/purrr")
```

## Usage

The following example uses purrr to solve a fairly realistic problem: split a data frame into pieces, fit a model to each piece, compute the summarse, then extract the R^2^.

```{r}
library(purrr)

mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>% # from base R
  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

This example illustrates some of the advantages of purrr functions over the equivalents in base R:

* The first argument is always the data, so purrr works naturally with the pipe.

* All purrr functions are type-stable. They always return the advertised output
  type (`map()` returns lists; `map_dbl()` returns double vectors), or they 
  throw an errror.
  
* All `map()` functions either accept function, formulas (used for succinctly
  generating anonymous functions), a character vector (used to extract 
  components by name), or a numeric vector (used to extract by position).

## Philosophy

The goal is not to try and simulate Haskell in R: purrr does not implement currying or destructuring binds or pattern matching. The goal is to give you similar expressiveness to an FP language, while allowing you to write code that looks and works like R.

* Instead of point free style, use the pipe, `%>%`, to write code that can be
  read from left to right.

* Instead of currying, we use `...` to pass in extra arguments.

* Anonymous functions are verbose in R, so we provide two convenient shorthands.
  For unary functions, `~ .x + 1` is equivalent to `function(.x) .x + 1`.
  For chains of transformations functions, `. %>% f() %>% g()` is
  equivalent to `function(.) . %>% f() %>% g()`.

* R is weakly typed, we need variants `map_int()`, `map_dbl()`, etc since we 
  don't know what `.f` will return.

* R has named arguments, so instead of providing different functions for
  minor variations (e.g. `detect()` and `detectLast()`) I use a named
  argument, `.right`. Type-stable functions are easy to reason about so
  additional arguments will never change the type of the output.
