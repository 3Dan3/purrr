## Reverse dependencies

I have run R CMD check on the 147 downstream dependencies.
(Summary at https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/tree/master/revdep).

There were 4 packages with new problems (compared to running the
revdeps with the current CRAN version of purrr). All package
maintainers were notified on July 21 of these problems.

The maintainer of valaddin informed us that his package was already
fixed and will be sent to CRAN.
