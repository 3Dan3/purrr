# purrr 0.1.0.9000

* Experimental functions `maybe()`, `outputs()`, and `safe()` for working
  with functions that have side-effecty outputs (e.g. printed output,
  messages, warnings, and errors) (#120).

* Implement `set_names()`: a camel case alternative to `setNames()` with
  stricter equality checking (#119).
